## Introduction

Contained in this repo is a simple game of Noughts and Crosses whic was created by myself using a mixture of html and jsx in React.

This game is the first one I ever created and, although not perfect, I'm incredibly proud that I was able to take this first step in starting to create app. This was a great exercise in hooking together the various pieces of data in the state, and the winning logic is something that took quite a bit of work to get implemented.

Feel free to play the game yourself. Naturally it's designed for two people and won't let you start until two names have been entered.
